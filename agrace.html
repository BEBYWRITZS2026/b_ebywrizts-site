    <p class="subtitle">A poem of conviction, warning, and truth</p>

    <div class="poem">
A grave disgrace.
A fall in grace
Why make that mistake, when you know your
life finally fell into place.
You invited christ into your life
Gave him your lives wheel and told him to
drive,
And when you were getting to that junction,
where your having breath finally receives its
function.
You push him out of the seat, lying to
yourself that you have finally found your
feet.
Successfully dancing to the devils beat.

Ooh you foolish believer,
Why would you give space for the deceiver,
you were in labor ready to deliver,
Then you let your child get stolen by Him
they call LUCIFER.
Yes you were unguarded, one of the ways
you can take your future for granted.
A future you could not even picture,
You expected the devil not to capture??
Why were you soo afraid, dismayed, the
doubts, the complaints.
You were not informed?
Life is but just a charade,
Where truth and lies are both well played.
Why then wouldn't you lean on YAHWEH.
Don't you know that he is the truth, the life
and THE WAYY
